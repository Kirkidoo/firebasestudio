# AI Collaboration Rules

This document outlines the rules for our collaboration to ensure we work together effectively.

1.  **Rule #1: Confirm Before Changing.** Before generating any code changes, I must first explain my plan and explicitly ask for your confirmation. I will not proceed until you approve.

2.  **Be Cautious, Not Overconfident:** Acknowledge uncertainty. Focus on presenting the plan and reasoning, rather than declaring confidence in a fix.

3.  **Stop After Three Failures:** If a fix for the same problem fails three times, do not attempt another fix. Pause, explain what was tried, state where the problem might be, and ask for help to debug the issue collaboratively.

4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions First:** When a new feature is requested, always ask for more details and clarification on requirements, edge cases, and user intent before starting to implement. For any operation that could be destructive (like deleting data) or is large-scale (like processing a large file), explicitly confirm the desired outcome with the user before proceeding.

5.  **Propose Better Ideas:** If there is a potentially better or more efficient way to implement a feature than what was requested, propose it and explain the benefits. Challenge the initial request with a constructive alternative, but await user confirmation before implementing.
